&lt;pre&gt;

Hello everyone!

I am proud to present crmsh version 2.3.0, the latest stable
release. I would recommend all users to upgrade to 2.3.0 if they
can.

For this release, I would like to begin by highlighting the new
contributors to crmsh since 2.2.0 was released in January:

* Marc A. Smith added the new subcommand &quot;configure load push&quot;, which
  removes any configuration lines that aren't included in the cib
  provided when pushing.

* Andrei Maruha added an optional name parameter to the &quot;corosync
  add-node&quot; command, and made the add-node command recycle old node
  IDs if possible.

* Kai Kang fixed a build system bug when removing generated docs,
  causing issues with parallel make.

* Daniel Hoffend contributed various fixes improving support for
  building crmsh for Debian and Ubuntu.

* Pedro Salgado fixed a bug in the graph rendering code in crmsh,
  added a tox configuration file to make testing with multiple
  versions of Python easy, and updated the Travis CI configuration to
  use tox.

* Nate Clark fixed a bug in the parser for fencing hierarchies.

I would also like to thank all the other contributors, testers and
users who have helped in making this release as stable and reliable as
possible.

Some of the other major features in 2.3.0 include:

* Support for the new event-based alerts feature in Pacemaker 1.1.15

* Greatly improved timezone handling in crm report and the history
  explorer

* Improvements to the cluster scripts / wizards, as well as new
  wizards for LVM on DRBD, and NFS on LVM and DRBD and VMware/vCenter

* Better support for fencing remote nodes

The source code can be downloaded from Github:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/releases/tag/2.3.0

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.3.0.tar.gz
* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.3.0.zip

For the full list of changes since version 2.3.0, see the ChangeLog,

<content type="html">
&lt;pre&gt;

Today I'm announcing two new releases of crmsh: 2.2.1 and 2.1.6.

Both are stable releases, and I would recommend all users to
upgrade to crmsh 2.2.1 if they can.

== crmsh 2.2.1

Here is a brief list of the most significant changes in this release:

* Rewritten history explorer internally to improve performance significantly
* Allow configuring reload operation
* Fix fencing for remote nodes
* Recycle corosync node IDs when possible
* Several bug fixes in crm report
* Warn if generated report is empty
* Improved SBD cluster script
* Add push method for configure load
* Fixed cluster init

The source code can be downloaded from Github:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/releases/tag/2.2.1

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.2.1.tar.gz

available at:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/blob/2.2.1/ChangeLog

== crmsh 2.1.6

This is a bug fix release.
Most fixes are minor or related to time handling in reports.

For a complete list of changes since the previous version, please
refer to the changelog:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/blob/2.1.6/ChangeLog

Currently I'm not building binary releases for 2.1.6 as the stable
series (at OBS) is at 2.2. This release is intended for users of
the 2.1 series who have yet to migrate to 2.2.

<title>crmsh 2.2.0 is released</title>
<id>tag:crmsh.github.io,2014:/atom::825d8489a7a363d9418a53b0b30d3d59606b2266</id>

&lt;pre&gt;

In June of last year, I released Release Candidate 3 of crmsh 2.2.0,
and I honestly expected to have the final version ready no more than a
few weeks later. Well, it took around 6 months, but now it is finally
here!

The source code can be downloaded from Github:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/releases/tag/2.2.0

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.2.0.tar.gz
* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/archive/2.2.0.zip

There are many new features and quite a few bug fixes, but I'll try to
describe some of the major changes below. For the full list of changes
since version 2.1, see the ChangeLog. I am also including the list
of changes since RC3 in the release notes below.

* https://github.com/ClusterLabs/crmsh/blob/2.2.0/ChangeLog

New features introduced in this version:

* Support for many of the new features introduced in Pacemaker
  1.1.14, including improved support for Pacemaker Remote and
  pattern-based fencing topology configurations.

* The cluster scripts have been greatly improved and are now used as
  the wizards backend for hawk. Together with the improvements in the
  cluster scripts, the crmsh template sublevel has been deprecated,
  and all of the templates are now available as cluster scripts. The
  template sublevel will be removed in a future version.

* The history explorer now replaces the combined log and event files
  from hb_report using the commands crm history log and crm history
  events. Additionally, the info summary now highlights transitions
  that contain error logs or other potentially interesting events.

* Improved verification before committing new changes, for example
  crmsh now warns if colocation constraints are applied to group
  children.

* resource start / stop / restart now take multiple resource arguments.

* Added a maintenance sublevel with commands intended to simplify the
  use of maintenance mode.

* Switched to using the python parallax library instead of pssh for
  remote node communication. Parallax is a fork of pssh with
  additional features added specifically for using it as a python
  library rather than a command line tool. Packages for
  python-parallax can be downloaded from the OBS, or it can be
  installed from PyPI.

<title>Announcing crmsh stable release 2.1.4</title>
<id>tag:crmsh.github.io,2014:/atom::42ff35c4489d046ef8eeff7b0c1d7a75d51b5f25</id>
<updated>2015-05-13T15:30:00CET</updated>
<link>http://crmsh.github.io/news/2015-05-13-release-2_1_4</link>
<content type="html">
&lt;pre&gt;

Today we are proud to announce the release of `crmsh` version 2.1.4!
2.1.4 is a minor bug fix release with no major issues, so users
already running 2.1.3 are mostly fine. Instead, the main reason
for releasing 2.1.4 is as an excuse to talk about some other things
that are happening with crmsh!

The details for this release are available below.

History Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dejan has written a guide to using the crmsh history
command. For those who are unfamiliar with the history explorer or
want to know more about how to use it, this guide is a great
introduction to what it does and how to use it.

History is not a new crmsh feature, but, as we failed to
advertise it and nothing works without proper marketing, it
probably hasn't seen a very wide use. That's surely a pity and we
hope that this gentle history guide is going to help. 

So, if you use crmsh and if you need help troubleshooting
clusters (I surely do!), take a look here:

http://crmsh.github.io/history-guide/

FYI, the comprehensive crmsh help also has a short description of
the feature:

........
crm history help
........

Goes without saying: all commands are described too.

If you don't use crmsh, you'll still find a lot of useful
information in the guide, so don't skip it.

Hawk Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I presented Hawk [1] and the History Explorer interface which
builds upon the crmsh history feature at openSUSE conf in The Hague
earlier this month. The video of that presentation is online here:

2.2.0 Development News
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While 2.1.4 is the latest stable release, I am also working on releasing
2.2.0 which will come with a bunch of new features. I'm still working
on some of these and not everything is in the repository yet, so
2.2.0 is probably at least a month or so away still. I was perhaps
a bit optimistic when I tagged RC1 back in October last year. ;)

However, right now I'd like to focus on one thing that is already in
2.2.0 and which is available if you use the development packages from
OBS: command shorthands. This makes crmsh a lot more convenient to use
from the command line. Basically, you can use any unambiguous subset
of a command name to refer to that command, and crmsh will figure out
what you mean. This may sound confusing, so an example will help with
explaining what I mean:

This is one way of showing the current cluster configuration:

........
crm configure show
........

However, now you can shorten this to the following:

........
crm cfg show
........

Other examples of shorthand are `crm rsc stop r1` or `crm st`
for status. And of course, tab completion in bash still works for
the shorthand variants.

The examples used here are not comprehensive. crmsh is pretty clever
at figuring out which command was intended. Download the development
release and try it out!

&lt;pre&gt;

Today we are proud to announce the release of `crmsh` version 2.1!
This version primarily fixes all known issues found since the release
of `crmsh` 2.0 in April, but also has some major new features.

A massive thank you to everyone who has helped out with bug fixes,
comments and contributions for this release!

For a complete list of changes since the previous version, please
refer to the changelog:

* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/blob/2.1.0/ChangeLog

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/archive/2.1.0.tar.gz
* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/archive/2.1.0.zip

Here are some of the highlights of this release:

== Rule expressions in attribute lists

One of the biggest features in this release is full support for rule
expressions wherever the XML syntax allows them.

Here is an example of using rule expressions in an attribute list in
order to set the virtual IP of an IPAddr2 resource to a different
value on a specific node.

----
primitive vip-on-node1 IPAddr2 \
    rule 10: #uname eq node1 ip=10.0.0.5 \
    rule 1: ip=10.0.0.6
----

== Tags in the CIB

A new feature added to Pacemaker recently is tags. This is a way
to refer to multiple resources at once without creating any
colocation or ordering relationship between them. For example, you
could add all resources related to the database to a db tag, and
then stop or start them all with a single command.

----
tag db drbd:Master fs sql-db
----

It is also possible to refer to tags in constraints.

== Wildcards in show/edit

The configure show and edit commands can now use glob-style
wildcards to refer to multiple resources:

----
configure edit db-*
----

== Nvpair references

Sometimes, different resources name the same parameters with different
names. For example, an IPAddr2 may have an ip parameter that should be
the same as a web servers server_ip parameter. By using nvpair
references, it is possible to configure the ip in a single location.

Note that this is a new feature in Pacemaker 1.1.12 and up.

----
primitive vip IPAddr2 params $my-ip:ip=192.168.0.1
primitive www apache params @my-ip:server_ip
----

== New ACL syntax

The support for Access Control Lists has been revised in Pacemaker
1.1.12, and this release of crmsh supports the new syntax. Two new 
commands have been added: `acl_target` and `acl_group`. For more details,
see the documentation.

Thank you,

Kristoffer and Dejan
