&lt;pre&gt;

Today we are proud to announce the release of `crmsh` version 2.1!
This version primarily fixes all known issues found since the release
of `crmsh` 2.0 in April, but also has some major new features.

A massive thank you to everyone who has helped out with bug fixes,
comments and contributions for this release!

For a complete list of changes since the previous version, please
refer to the changelog:

* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/blob/2.1.0/ChangeLog

Packages for several popular Linux distributions can be downloaded
from the Stable repository at the OBS:

* http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/Stable/

Archives of the tagged release:

* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/archive/2.1.0.tar.gz
* https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh/archive/2.1.0.zip

Here are some of the highlights of this release:

== Rule expressions in attribute lists

One of the biggest features in this release is full support for rule
expressions wherever the XML syntax allows them.

Here is an example of using rule expressions in an attribute list in
order to set the virtual IP of an IPAddr2 resource to a different
value on a specific node.

----
primitive vip-on-node1 IPAddr2 \
    rule 10: #uname eq node1 ip=10.0.0.5 \
    rule 1: ip=10.0.0.6
----

== Tags in the CIB

A new feature added to Pacemaker recently is tags. This is a way
to refer to multiple resources at once without creating any
colocation or ordering relationship between them. For example, you
could add all resources related to the database to a db tag, and
then stop or start them all with a single command.

----
tag db drbd:Master fs sql-db
----

It is also possible to refer to tags in constraints.

== Wildcards in show/edit

The configure show and edit commands can now use glob-style
wildcards to refer to multiple resources:

----
configure edit db-*
----

== Nvpair references

Sometimes, different resources name the same parameters with different
names. For example, an IPAddr2 may have an ip parameter that should be
the same as a web servers server_ip parameter. By using nvpair
references, it is possible to configure the ip in a single location.

Note that this is a new feature in Pacemaker 1.1.12 and up.

----
primitive vip IPAddr2 params $my-ip:ip=192.168.0.1
primitive www apache params @my-ip:server_ip
----

== New ACL syntax

The support for Access Control Lists has been revised in Pacemaker
1.1.12, and this release of crmsh supports the new syntax. Two new 
commands have been added: `acl_target` and `acl_group`. For more details,
see the documentation.

Thank you,

Kristoffer and Dejan
