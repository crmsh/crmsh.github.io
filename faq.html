<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_is_the_crm_shell">What is the crm shell?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell is a command-line interface to the Pacemaker cluster
resource management stack. If that doesn&#8217;t make any sense to you, the
easiest way to get up to speed is to go to the
<a href="http://clusterlabs.org/">Pacemaker</a> website and read more about what it
does there.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell provides a simpler interface to configuring Pacemaker
than manipulating the XML of the CIB (Cluster Information Base)
directly. With its command-line style interface, changes to the
cluster can be performed quickly and painlessly. It also works as a
scripting tool, allowing more complicated changes to be applied to the
cluster.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell also functions as a management console, providing a
unified interface to a number of other auxilliary tools related to
Pacemaker and cluster management.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_distributions_does_the_shell_run_on">What distributions does the shell run on?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many distributions provide packages for the <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell in their
respective package repositories. The best and safest way to obtain the
<span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell is via the distribution repositories, so look there first.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The intention is for the <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell to work well on all the major
distributions. Pre-built packages are provided for the
following distros:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
openSUSE
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fedora
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
CentOS
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Red Hat Linux
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>More information can be found on the
<a href="documentation.html#_installation">Documentation</a> page.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_didn_8217_t_crm_use_to_be_part_of_pacemaker">Didn&#8217;t crm use to be part of Pacemaker?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Yes, initially, the <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell was distributed as part of the
Pacemaker project. It was split into its own, separate project in
2011.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A common misconception is that <span class="monospaced">crm</span> has been replaced by <span class="monospaced">pcs</span>
(available at <a href="https://github.com/feist/pcs">github.com/feist/pcs</a>). <span class="monospaced">pcs</span>
is an alternative command line interface similar to <span class="monospaced">crm</span>. Both
projects are being actively developed, with slightly different
goals. Our recommendation is to use whatever shell your distribution
of choice comes with and supports, unless you have a particular
preference or are on a distribution which doesn&#8217;t bundle either. In
that case, we are obviously biased towards one of the available
choices. ;)</p></div>

<h2 id="_command_line_is_well_and_good_but_is_there_a_web_interface">Command-line is well and good, but is there a web interface?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Yes! Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk">Hawk</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hawk uses the <span class="monospaced">crm</span> shell as its backend to interact with the cluster.</p></div>
